<h2>The Struggle Is Real</h2>

</div>
<div class="panel-body">

<p>The Martial Arts require dedication and heart, which our followers have in spades. To be successful, it also takes time, effort, and financial input for things like academy fees, equipment, and proper nutrition. While it’s the dream of many to become sponsored fighters and get paid to train and live the lifestyle of a professional athlete, more often than not the burden is on the fighter to sacrifice and fund his own journey. This usually includes a “normal job” on top of the hours required for training, self-promoting, eating right, and sleeping enough to recover adequately.

<h2>We’re Here To Help</h2>

<p>Luckily, our hardships often reveal to us that we’re not alone. Here at IndieMMA we are doing our part by providing a FREE central location to build a professional Fighter Profile which will help to document and highlight your personal stats (tournaments/fights, locations, wins/losses), media (pictures, videos), training (seminars attended, gym check-ins, document routines), and future goals. Creating a profile not only allows you to promote yourself to friends, family, fans, and promoters, but it will also naturally lead to networking within the Martial Arts community.

<h2>Here’s The Kicker!</h2>

</div>
<div class="panel-body">
<p>IndieMMA also provides a service through which fighters can search for and catalogue a list of their “Wants” and “Needs,” be it a new tournament gi, a new mouthguard, or a seminar fee that is upcoming. The friends, family, and fans of the fighters can then click on the links to easily lend support by purchasing these items online and having them sent to the location predetermined by the fighter. Holiday? Birthday? No problem...just say, “Visit my page on IndieMMA.com!”

   Create a profile and display what you have.
   Start a “Wants” and “Needs” list to document the things that will
   help you to achieve your goals. Show the world what we can do when we all help one another. Promote. Support.
   Conquer.</p></div>
